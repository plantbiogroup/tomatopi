<ul>
<li><b>Gene Gun </b> : One of the cornerstones of modern plant biology is genetic transformation, the insertion of new genes or genetic material into plant genomes.  The two primary means of genetic transformation in plants are using disable versions of natures genetic engineer, Agrobacterium, or biolistics making use of a gene gun. Our initial goals are to develop these core capabilities and make them accessible across DIYbio labs.

<li><b>Automated Cloning and expression using Infusion</b> : Underlying all synthetic biology expts is a uniquely assembled DNA clone. This process is fraught with failures and heartbreaks. We are approaching cloning problem for DIY labs in optimized traditional RE/Ligation cloning  and trying the In-Fusion cloning system. Our first attempt is to add  a chromogenic protein and fusing it, in-frame, with the GFP reporter protein in the pCambia 1302 vector for transformations that do not depend on a epi-fluorescence microscopy only. We will determine if the In-Fusion cloning system is robust enough to be used with cloning on automated, cloud-based molecular biology systems. The protocol will be made available to all DIY scientists to be able to online cost effective cloning of their genetic material.  

<li><b>BioDome</b> : The BioDome project is a vital part of our infrastructure for
producing high quality plant tissue for experimentation.  The
BioDome can sustain an optimal growing environment without operator
intervention for months at a time.  The web interface provides control
and supervision capabilities for your plants.
Sophisticated graphing and video capabilities allows you to perform
sophisticated post harvest analysis for the crop.  The data set for the
plants from planting to harvest can be reviewed for fine tuning the
growth parameters.

The BioDome system consists of a web server and a dome client.
The web server acts as a collection point for data and as a globally
accessible control point for adjusting the growth parameters.  The
client can measure up to 6 different environmental parameters and
actuate up to 8 devices such as heater, water dispenser, and nutrient
dispenser.

The sophisticated analysis and control program in the client ensures
that your parameters are maintained over the entire growing season.  You
can even vary the parameters according to the season, the time of day,
or any other function of time or environmental conditions.

<li><b>Grafting and hybrids</b> : Plant grafting and hybridization has a rich history going back thousands of years. Work has been done to bring these tried-and-trued technologies into the 21st Century. One goal of this subproject to develop an automated or semi-automated DIY grafting machine. To start, we are practicing with manual grafting of tomato and potato. Not only are both Solanaceae plants (traditionally easier to work with than other plant families) it has the added benefit of creating a ‘Pomato’ – a plant which is a tomato above ground and a potato below ground!

<li><b>Crispr/Cas9</b> : Genome Editing – We seek to explore low cost and reliable genome editing methods. Our current focus is on CRISPR based systems such as cas9 and cpf1 technology. Thus far we have had success with in-vitro edits of DNA. Specifically, we designed a guide RNA that when used in conjunction with cas9 cuts a location on the ADE2 gene of yeast. The ADE2 gene, when disrupted causes a harmless red pigment to build up in the yeast. To ensure that our guide RNA works as intended, we tested it in vitro on a PCR amplicon of a segment of the ADE2 gene. Future goals include testing our guide RNA in vivo, and exploring ways to improve the reliability of the HDR or NHEJ process.

<li><b>Hairy roots</b> : Many plants produce novel metabolites and compounds in their roots.  One way to mass produce such compounds is to create 'immortalized' roots using natures 'natural' genetic engineer A. rhizogenes.  Our initial set of experiments are on beets which naturally produce colored compounds in their roots called anthocyanins.  Our goal is to develop this as a system and experimental model to include other plant species and other compounds/proteins.

<li><b>Genetic Diversity</b> : Bananas and plantains are incredibly important crops world-wide, both in economic terms, and as a food staple. However, due to careful selection during millenia of cultivation, modern domesticated bananas are (almost) completely seedless, which makes it very challenging to breed new cultivars. Our banana project is focused on using directed mutagenesis and other biotechnological tools to create greater genetic diversity in our starting stock, the 'Dwarf Cavendish'. As part of the project, we're learning and sharing lots of biology lab skills, including tissue culture techniques, vegetative propagation methods, and genetic screening and analysis. Hopefully, we will have something delicious to show for our efforts some day.
<!--li><b>Protein purification </b>: </li--> 
<li><b>Yeast transformation and protein expression </b>:Yeast are versatile organisms that can be adapted to manufacture proteins of almost any kind. We are developing robotic protocols to streamline this process and eventually produce proteins of any sequence at the touch of a button. Using our modified yeast we think we can create beers that tell you when they are stale and concoctions that gives pigs higher muscular mass. 

<li><b>Tissue culture and plant regeneration</b> : In contrast to mammalian systems, tissue culture and regeneration are standard techniques to modern plant biology.  Plants can be cloned at an industrial scale and/or whole plants can be regenerated from single cells. We aim to make these techniques - whole plant cloning and regeneration from single cells or tissue accessible to a wide range of DIYBio labs. 
<li><b>Beer and Fermentation science</b> : We are taking a scientific approach to brewing by fermenting small 1 Gal or less batches and taking rigorous measurements. Our goal is to gain a deep understanding of the fermentation process in brewing, then move on to more challenging projects. Currently, we are investigating creating a high protein content beer and finding new California yeast strains, among other possibilities. Ideas are welcome if you'd like to get involved!
