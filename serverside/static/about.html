What is a phytonaut? 

A phytonaut stands on a three legged stool.  The first leg is education/training.  The second 

quality science. The third application of that knowledge to the real world.  

It is a cliché but it is true - one's education and training are never complete.  This is especially 

true in light of the ever-increasing rate at which papers, discoveries, and insights are being made.  As a 

result, we need to be both vigilant and prudent about keeping up with the latest cutting edge research. 

While all this is well and good for those that have some training, what about those who do not? An 

important piece of the phytonautic’s mission is to test the hypothesis that one can get quality 

education/training without the need for an advanced degree.  

As highlighted by the quote from ‘Arrowsmith’ above, the quality of science must be of the 

highest standards. Quality does not mean cutting edge here, quality means design of the experiment, 

inclusion of controls, reproducibility, and a clear separation from results and conclusions. A phytonaut 

strives to put quality of science over all else. 

Finally, a phytonaut tries to apply their hard won knowledge and even harder fought results, to 

the larger world. We face a number of daunting challenging in the relatively near to medium term 

future. To tackle these challenges and turn them into opportunities, we need an army of well-trained, 

rigorous, and creative scientists working together. 

So are you a phytonaut?

    Do you remember when you were a child, and you bit in to a ripe tomato?
      ... and your head exploded with the taste?
        ... and the skin burst in streams of red juice with seed falling to the ground?
          ... and all you could think of was how good it all was?
    

    Bring back flavour to your life.  It's too short to waste on mediocre food.
